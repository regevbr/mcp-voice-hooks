# mcp-voice-hooks

Real-time voice interaction for Claude Code. Speak naturally while Claude works - interrupt, redirect, or provide continuous feedback without stopping.

## Demo

## Overview

mcp-voice-hooks enables continuous voice conversations with AI assistants by:

- Capturing voice input in real-time through a web interface
- Queuing utterances for processing by Claude Code
- Using hooks to ensure Claude checks for voice input before tool use and before stopping
- Allowing natural interruptions like "No, stop that" or "Wait, try something else"

## Features

- 🎤 **Real-time Voice Capture**: Browser-based speech recognition with automatic segmentation
- 🔄 **Continuous Interaction**: Keep talking while Claude works - no need to stop between commands
- 🪝 **Smart Hook System**: Pre-tool and stop hooks ensure Claude always checks for your input

## Installation in Your Own Project

1. **Install the hooks** (first time only):

   ```bash
   npx mcp-voice-hooks install-hooks
   ```

   This will:
   - Install hook scripts to `~/.mcp-voice-hooks/hooks/`
   - Configure your project's `.claude/settings.json`

2. **Add the MCP server** to your project's `.mcp.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "voice-hooks": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["mcp-voice-hooks"],
         "env": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Start Claude Code**:

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

4. **Open the voice interface** at <http://localhost:3000> and start speaking! Note: you need to send one text message to Claude to trigger the voice hooks.

## Development Mode

If you're developing mcp-voice-hooks itself:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-voice-hooks.git
cd mcp-voice-hooks

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Link the package locally
npm link

# 4. Install hooks (one time)
npx mcp-voice-hooks install-hooks

# 5. Start Claude Code
claude
```

NOTE: You need to restart Claude Code each time you make changes.

### Hot Reload

For hot reload during development, you can run the development server with

```bash
npm run dev-unified
```

and then configure claude to use the mcp proxy like so:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "voice-hooks": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "mcp-proxy"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## WIP voice responses

Add the post tool hook to your claude settings:

```json
{
   {
     "hooks": {
        "PostToolUse": [
            {
                "matcher": "^mcp__voice-hooks__",
                "hooks": [
                    {
                        "type": "command",
                        "command": "./.claude/hooks/post-tool-voice-hook.sh"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
     },
     "env": {
       "VOICE_RESPONSES_ENABLED": "true"
     }
   }
}
```

### Configuration

Voice responses are disabled by default. To enable them:

Add to your Claude Code settings JSON:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "VOICE_RESPONSES_ENABLED": "true"
  }
}
```

To disable voice responses, set the value to `false` or remove the setting entirely.
